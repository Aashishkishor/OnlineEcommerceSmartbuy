# OnlineEcommerceSmartbuy
OnlineEcommerceSmartbuy is a desktop-based Java Project that allows users (Admin) to log in, view products, filter by categories, search items, and manage inventory visually. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Swing UI development, event handling, and modular Java project design and aslo use the DBMS concepts in details.
The application allows the Admin to log in, search products, filter categories, view stock, and interact with a visually rich UI.
It also demonstrates full OOP concepts, Collections, JDBC database connectivity, multithreading, and exception handling in details.

# 📌Project Overview
This project showcases how an OnlineEcommerceSmartbuy works internally using core Java.
It includes:

A Login Module

A Product Dashboard

Search and Category Filtering

Product Listing in Dynamic Panels

Database Connectivity via JDBC

Object-Oriented Design using Java Classes

# ✨Features
OOP Architecture/Concepts — Polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling for modular code.
